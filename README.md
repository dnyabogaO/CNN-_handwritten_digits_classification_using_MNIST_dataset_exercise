# CNN-_handwritten_digits_classification_using_MNIST_dataset_exercise
Use CNN to do handwritten digits classification using MNIST dataset. You can use this notebook as a reference: https://github.com/codebasics/deep-learning-keras-tf-tutorial/blob/main/1_digits_recognition/digits_recognition_neural_network.ipynb. 

Above we used ANN for digits classification. You need to modify this code to use CNN instead. Check how accuracy improves fast with CNN and figure out how CNN can be a better choice for doing image classification compared to ANN. Once you have worked on this problem on your own, you can check my solution by clicking on this link:
